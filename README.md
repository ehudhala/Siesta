# Siesta
The Siesta Programming Language.

## What is this?

The goal of this project is to learn both c++ and compiler theory.
The result will be a compiler for a simple language using LLVM.

I am curretnly following this [tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl01.html).
The tutorial aims strictly at compiler design but I'm also interested in c++,
so the result is the same programming language, with a better codebase.

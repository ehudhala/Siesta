# Siesta
The Siesta Programming Language.

## What is this?
This is the result of me learning both c++ and compiler theory.
The result will be a compiler for a simple language using LLVM.

I am curretnly following this [tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl01.html).
The tutorial aims strictly at compiler design and I'm also interesten in c++,
so the resulting code is really different.
